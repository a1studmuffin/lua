lua-5.1.5 fork for Cataclysm DDA Android
========================================

This is a fork of lua-5.1.5. The only difference is it contains an Android.mk file for compiling with the Android build of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).
You can probably use this for other Android NDK projects too, but it's really just here for convenience.
